Welcome to BoardPoster

Boardposter is a project designed to put a single post at specified time on specified board as user.

Of course it won't be another spamming machine as it's not my purpose, it's more like (self)educational project
as it gives me various interesting problems to solve from the beginning without overwhelming dulness of making another
pure hello world equivalent.

Feel free to point out any bugs/wrong patterns and so on, that's the main reason of making it public.

Installation:

As it's simple, typical Rails app everything goes as usual, with two small caveats:

1. Clone project.
2. $ bundle install
   I left postgresql as DB, so if you neither have it nor want to install it you have to change adapter to another in:
    config/database.yml
3. $ rake db:schema:load
4. To get verification email after registration you have to fill configuration at the bottom (config.action_mailer) in:
    config/environments/[RAILS_ENV].rb
5. $ rails s
